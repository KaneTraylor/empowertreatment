## Important Notes

1. **Phone Number Format**: Ensure all phone numbers include the country code (e.g., +1 for US numbers)
2. **SMS Costs**: Each SMS sent will incur Twilio charges
3. **Error Handling**: SMS failures won't prevent form submission - they're logged but don't block the process
4. **Privacy**: Ensure clinician phone numbers are kept secure and not committed to version control

## Testing

To test SMS functionality:
1. Submit a test form with a valid phone number
2. Check that clinicians receive their alert SMS
3. Verify that the submitter receives their confirmation SMS
4. Test with different urgency levels to see the different message formats
