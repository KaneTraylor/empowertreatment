# Test Results Summary

## Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 44
- **Passing**: 34
- **Failing**: 10
- **Test Suites**: 6 total (4 passed, 2 failed)

## Passing Test Suites ✅
1. **useMultiStepForm Hook** - All 8 tests passing
2. **MultiStepForm Component** - All 7 tests passing  
3. **API verify-otp** - All 5 tests passing
4. **OTPStep Component** - All 9 tests passing

## Failing Test Suites ❌

### 1. API send-sms (5 failures)
**Issue**: The Twilio client mock is not properly set up, causing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'messages')`

**Fix needed**: Update the mock to properly return the messages.create method

### 2. LocationStep Component (5 failures)
**Issues**:
- Some tests expect elements that don't appear until after state selection
- Phone input placeholder might be different than expected
- Validation message text might not match exactly

**Fix needed**: Update tests to match actual component behavior

## Key Issues to Address

1. **API Mocking**: The Twilio and SendGrid mocks need proper setup in tests
2. **Async Rendering**: Some component tests need better async handling
3. **Element Queries**: Some tests are looking for elements with wrong selectors

## Recommendations

1. Focus on fixing the API mocks first as they're blocking integration tests
2. Update LocationStep tests to properly handle the conditional rendering
3. Consider adding more integration tests once unit tests are stable
4. Add E2E tests for the complete form flow

## Test Coverage Areas

✅ **Well Tested**:
- Form state management
- Navigation between steps
- OTP input handling
- Basic validation

⚠️ **Needs More Testing**:
- SMS/Email sending integration
- Error handling edge cases
- Accessibility
- Performance under load

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 10 failing tests
2. Add missing integration tests
3. Set up E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Configure CI/CD to run tests automatically
